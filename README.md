## 📍 About This Repository

This repository is a **personal learning project** where I (Omkar 👨‍💻) am mastering Java by breaking down each concept into its **own file**, writing detailed **in-code documentation**, and sharing the journey publicly.

🎯 The main purpose of this project is to relearn all Java fundamentals, strengthen my understanding through hands-on practice, and share this journey openly with my peers and anyone else learning alongside me.

Each Java file includes:
- 🧠 **Theory notes** written as comments
- 💻 **Practical examples** to run and test
- 🔎 **Explanations** for every line, keyword, and behavior
- ✅ **Real-world patterns** and clean structure

Whether you're learning Java for the first time or brushing up your skills, this repo is built to **teach clearly and effectively**.

## 🧠 Why I'm Doing This

- 🔍 To **understand Java deeply [RE-LEARN]** by building every concept from scratch.
- ✍️ To **practice teaching** through clean code and human-readable explanations.
- 📖 To make Java easy and accessible for others who want to learn too.
- 💼 To showcase this as part of my **developer portfolio** and open-source journey.
